<!-- Plugin description -->
Adds a way to write php in PhpStorm/IDEA and run it directly as if through `laravel artisan tinker` - allowing you to quickly run a piece of code with all your Laravel classes -
with the added benefit of having your IDE's autocompletion, code colors and error inspections.

Find all actions under `Tools -> Laravel Tinker` or use the default shortcut `ctrl + Shift + T` to let tinker smartly guess what you want to do (opening/running/etc.).
