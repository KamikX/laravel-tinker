<!-- Plugin description -->
Easily write and execute PHP code directly in PhpStorm/IDEA as if using `laravel artisan tinker`. Enjoy the convenience of running code snippets with full access to your Laravel classes, enhanced by your IDE’s autocompletion, syntax highlighting, and error inspections.

Access all plugin actions via `Tools -> Laravel Tinker` or use the default shortcut `ctrl + Shift + T` to let Tinker intelligently determine your intent (open, run, etc.).
